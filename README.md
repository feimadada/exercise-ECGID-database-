exercise ECGID database 




The database is collected in a lab at South China University of Technology. The database includes pre and post exercise recordings for 45 subjects. There are 33 males and 12 females whose age is between 18 to 22. Each subject in this set performed a few basic structural workouts such as steady running and climbing the stairs. The ecg signals are recorded from the wrist and the length of recordings in rest condition and post-exercise condition are around 5 minutes and 150 seconds respectively. The heart rate in post-exercise condition is range from 90 to 150 compared with around 70 in rest condition. The ECG signal was captured in lead II and the sampling frequency is 300 Hz.

In this database, the files that have contiguous numbers come from one subject, and the odd number means pre-exercise the even number means post-exercise. For example, 1.txt and 2.txt are pre-exercise recording and post-exercise recording of subject 1, respectively. And 3.txt and 4.txt are pre-exercise recording and post-exercise recording of subject 2, respectively. The rest can be done in the same manner.
